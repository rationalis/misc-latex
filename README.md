These are various LaTeX write-ups for UCSD CSE courses:

- Theory of Computability
- Topics in CSE: Neural Networks
- (Graduate) Topics in CSE: Convex Optimization

Note that these are not flawless final drafts, nor original work (as in novel results;
they were all, of course, assignments completed only by the students who received the
grade for them). In particular, for the convex optimization report, the pronoun "we" is
often used, but the report is only meant to summarize the cited research papers.
